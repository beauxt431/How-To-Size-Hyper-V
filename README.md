# How-To-Size-Hyper-V
Sizing with Powershell via Hyper V
Hyper-V Reporting Script (Powershell & HTML)
It can be difficult to monitor and assess resources in large Hyper-V environments. This Powershell based script helps you to understand virtualization inventory, capacity and general resource availability in your Standalone or Clustered Hyper-V Environment.



Highlights
Creates a plain but detailed and user-friendly HTML report which is compatible with all modern browsers.
Has an Overview section which shows momentary cluster resource usage.
Storage Overcommitment (see details below)
Shows alerts in the report for certain situations (utilizations, vm checkpoints, replication status, etc.)
Provides more detailed information via tooltips in the HTML report. (cells with asteriks and highlighted)
Includes a mode that reports only alerts in the Hyper-V environment. (aka HighlightsOnly mode)
Collects information by using standard Hyper-V and Clustering PowerShell cmdlets and custom WMI queries.
Checks and installs required runtime environment prerequisites like Hyper-V and Clustering Powershells.
Can be used directly from command-line or as a scheduled Windows task.
Supports report delivery via e-mail with advanced options. (authentication, TLS/SSL, multiple recipients)
Advanced error handling and logging. (Console messages and log file)

Requirements
Hyper-V Targets (Clustered or Standalone)

Active Directory domain membership
Supported Operating Systems
Windows Server 2012
Windows Server 2012 R2
Hyper-V Server 2012
Hyper-V Server 2012 R2
Script Runtime Operating System (Directly on a Hyper-V target or remote Windows operating system)

Same or trusted Active Directory domain membership with Hyper-V target
Supported Operating Systems
Windows Server 2012
Windows Server 2012 R2
Windows 8
Windows 8.1
Windows PowerShell 3.0 or 4.0 (installed by default on supported server operating systems)
Sets the Windows PowerShell execution policy to RemoteSigned or Unrestricted
Hyper-V PowerShell (if not, automatically installed by the Get-HyperVReport.ps1 for server oses)
Failover Clustering PowerShell (if not, automatically installed by the Get-HyperVReport.ps1 for server os')
The script requires administrative privileges on the target Hyper-V server(s)
Usage
1) Creates a Hyper-V Cluster report in the working directory.

.\Get-HyperVReport.ps1 -Cluster Hvcluster1

2) Creates a Hyper-V Cluster report that shown only highlighted events and alerts in the working directory.

.\Get-HyperVReport.ps1 -Cluster Hvcluster1 -HighlightsOnly $true

3) Creates one or more standalone Hyper-V Host(s) report in the working directory.

.\Get-HyperVReport.ps1 -VMHost Host1,Host2,Host3

4) Creates a Hyper-V Cluster report and sends it to multiple recipients as attachment without smtp authentication.

.\Get-HyperVReport.ps1 -Cluster Hvcluster1 -SendMail $true -SMTPServer 10.29.0.50 -MailFrom sender@hyperv.com -MailTo recepient1@hyperv.com,recepient2@hyperv.com

5) Creates a Hyper-V Cluster report and sends it to multiple recipients as attachment with smtp authentication and TLS/SSL communication. -SMTPServerTLSorSSL is optional and used if forced by the smtp server.

.\Get-HyperVReport.ps1 -Cluster Hvcluster1 -SendMail $true -SMTPServer smtp.mailserver.com -SMTPPort 587 -MailFrom sender@hyperv.com -MailFromPassword P@ssw0rd -SMTPServerTLSorSSL $true -MailTo recepient1@hyperv.com,recepient2@hyperv.com
